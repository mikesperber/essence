This is Essence 2.0!
====================

Welcome to Essence, a Generator for LR(k) and SLR(k) parsers in
Scheme.  Essence generates highly efficient parsers capable of
performing error recovery.

Running Essence requires Scheme 48.  The generated parsers, however,
are written in standard R5RS Scheme.

Installation instructions are in INSTALL.  More documentation is in
doc/essence.pdf or doc/html/essence.html, respectively.

Essence is based on work in partial evaluation described in the
following paper:

Michael Sperber and Peter Thiemann.
Generation of LR parsers by partial evaluation.
ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, 22(2):224-264, March 2000.
